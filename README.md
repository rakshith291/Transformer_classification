# Transformer_classification
Text classification using transformer by follwing keras https://keras.io/examples/nlp/text_classification_with_transformer/

I have aded few things in this notebook.

1. Obtaining the weight of the model layer-wise
2. Tapping the output from an intermediate-layer 
3. plotting the model arch details using keras plot_model utility
4. Over-writing the existing layer with custom changes (I have done a small change in multi head attention implementation)
5. Verifying the custom class implementation
